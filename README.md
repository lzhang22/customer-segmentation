## customer-segmentation
I explored customer segmentation using an online retail transactions data. The following analyses were done:
1. Cohort analysis of retention rate
2. Computation of recency (R), frequency (F), monetary value (M), and tenure of customer
3. K-means clustering to segment customers using RFM and tenure values
